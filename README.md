### Installation

1. Install required packages.

   ```
   npm install -g homebridge-mi-air-purifier miio
   ```

   ​

2. Make sure your Homebridge server is same network with your air purifier, then run following command to discover the token.

   ```
   miio --discover --sync
   ```


3. You may need to wait few minutes until you get the response similar to below:

   ```
   Device ID: 49466088
   Model info: Unknown
   Address: 192.168.1.8
   Token: 6f7a65786550386c700a6b526666744d via auto-token
   Support: Unknown
   ```

   ​

4. Record down the `Address` and `Token` values as we need it in our configuration file later.

5. If you are getting `??????????????` for your token value, please reset your device and connect your Homebridge server directly to the access point advertised by the device.

6. Then run the command again.

   ```
   miio --discover --sync
   ```

   ​

7. Add following accessory to the `config.json`.

   ```
     "accessories": [
       {
         "accessory": "MiAirPurifier",
         "name": "Air Purifier",
         "ip": "ADDRESS_OF_THE_AIR_PURIFIER",
         "token": "TOKEN_FROM_STEP_3",
         "showTemperature": true,
         "showHumidity": true,
         "showAirQuality": true
       }
     ]
   ```

   ​**Notes:** Set value for `showTemperature`, `showHumidity`, `showAirQuality` to **true** or **false** to show or hide these sensors in Home app.

   ​

8. Restart Homebridge, and your Mi air purifier will be added to Home app.
